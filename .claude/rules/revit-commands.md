# Writing a command or a panel

These load only when something in the Revit project is being touched. Everything else lives
in `CLAUDE.md`.

## The panel reaches Revit through one door and no other

`DrawingSheetPanel` is modeless. Its code runs whenever Windows raises an event, which is
almost never a moment Revit will accept an API call. Every single thing it wants doing goes
through `DrawingSheetRequestHandler` and the `ExternalEvent`.

Nothing in the panel may name a `Document`, a `Transaction`, a `FilteredElementCollector` or
an `ElementId`. If a new feature seems to need one there, it needs a new request on the
handler instead. This is the rule the panel is built around and the one that breaks Revit
hardest when it is bent.

The panel holds a `DrawingSheetSnapshot` of plain values and no Revit object at all. That is
what lets it stay open while the user closes one document and opens another.

## A read only command opens no transaction

Scan Model reads. Nothing in it writes, so nothing in it needs a `Transaction`, and adding
one would be the first step toward a command that changes a model while claiming to read it.

## A command that writes decides everything first, then asks, then writes once

Scope Box works out all six cases with no transaction open, shows the counts, and only then
opens a single transaction covering every assignment, so the whole run is one undo. The
progress window is not pumped while that transaction is open, because letting other clicks
through mid write is how a model ends up half changed.

## A command never overwrites something a person put there

Scope Box reports a view carrying the wrong scope box and leaves it alone. Someone chose it,
and this add-in does not know why.

## No brush is written in the panel file

The first install came up black on black. A dockable pane on Revit's dark theme sits on a
black background, WPF defaults a TextBlock to black text, and every heading, label and grid
label in the panel was invisible. `PanelTheme` reads `UIThemeManager.CurrentTheme` and hands
back a background, a foreground and one warning colour per theme. The panel sets Background
and Foreground on itself once, and every TextBlock under it inherits.

The only colour named anywhere else is the warning on a plot with no scope box, and it has a
value per theme because firebrick vanishes on dark grey. If a new element needs a colour, it
goes in `PanelTheme` with both values, not next to the element.

`PanelTheme` reads the theme without an external event, because a theme lookup touches no
document and the panel has to paint itself before any document exists. It lives in its own
file so `DrawingSheetPanel` names no Revit type at all.

## Any round that changes the panel writes an HTML mockup

`design/pr-<number>/panel.html`, drawn by hand from the code, so the layout and the wording
can be read before someone spends an install on it.

It says at the top, in the file itself, that it is a mockup and not a screenshot, and that it
cannot show how Revit will render it. That line is the whole point. A mockup passed off as a
screenshot is worse than no mockup, because it answers a question it never asked.

## The Reports buttons are the check on the panel

Scan Model and Scope Box read the whole model rather than a range. They are deliberately not
changed when the panel changes, because a control that moves with the thing it measures is
not a control. Scope Box still finds a view's plot from the view name alone. The panel finds
it from PRX_Plot_ID first. That difference is on purpose until the panel has been used on a
real model and the two counts compared.

## Building and installing

`CLAUDE.md` covers `install/install.ps1`. Two things it leaves out. `-Configuration Debug`
installs the debug build instead of release. And Revit 2023, 2025 and 2027 are also on the
build machine, so anything reading a Revit install path has to name 2024. Nothing here does.
`RevitAPI.dll` for 2024 sits at `C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit 2024\RevitAPI.dll`, and the
build never opens it. The two Nice3point packages supply the reference assemblies, so the
projects restore and compile on a machine with no Revit installed.
